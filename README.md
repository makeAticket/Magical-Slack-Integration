# Magical Slack Integration
 
This repository contains a prototype for integrating with Slack using Node.js. The application allows you to send messages to channels and convert raw data to Slack-formatted messages.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (version X.X.X or higher)
- npm (version X.X.X or higher)
- Access to a Slack workspace with a Slack app

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/slack-integration-prototype.git
   ```

2. Install the dependencies:

   ```bash
   cd slack-integration-prototype
   npm install
   ```

3. Configure the environment variables:

   - Create a new `.env` file in the root directory.
   - Add the following environment variables to the file:

     ```dotenv
     SLACK_CLIENT_ID=5296783228034.5296654907875
     SLACK_CLIENT_SECRET=423f05bdb0b6baa6bf8399fa4d778405
     SLACK_REDIRECT_URI=https://dalton.ngrok.io/oauth_redirect
     ```

4. Start the server:

   ```bash
   node index.js
   ```

5. Open your web browser and visit `https://dalton.ngrok.io` to access the application.

## Usage

1. Connect your Slack account:
   - Click on the "Connect to Slack" button on the homepage.
   - You will be redirected to authorize the app for your Slack workspace.
   - After authorization, you will be redirected back to the application.

2. Send messages to Slack channels:
   - Go to the "Upload" page.
   - Select a Slack channel from the dropdown.
   - Enter the message content in the text area. Here is an example I created using Magical's AI notes tool for 'Tesla's 2023 Earnings':
